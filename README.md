# DMT-Final-Project

This is a simple polyphonic synthesizer including two oscillators with amplitude ADSRs and AM LFOs.
Wave Table dial selects which wave shape you would like to turn on. Oscillator is off when it is set to 0.
LFO is off when rate is set to 0.
I intend on adding a filter envelope.
